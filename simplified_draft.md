# Introduction

We propose that normative influence in human decision-making is computationally primitive—not emergent from utility maximization, emotional response, or social learning—but a fundamental architectural component of moral cognition. To test this theoretical claim, we introduce the Normative Executive System (NES), extending the Drift Diffusion Model with an explicit norm weight parameter ($w_n$) that modulates decision dynamics independently of utility-based signals.
